# Changelog 

## 1.3 - 2023-04-24

- Use `.mjs` for ESM modules - some users were having trouble using this library in React native and this seems to be the cause.
- Change order to use ANS as a final fallback.
- Consistently use the terms **wallet names** and **wallet address** in internal functions (the term 'wallet' is way overloaded in Solana).
- Add a changelog.

## 1.2 - pre 2023-04-24

 - Original public release for Grizzlython.
